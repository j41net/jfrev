Went to catch up with SH over a few beers.

It was well over due given we had not met up the previous year. The chat was always good and as generous as SH is, the beers and food (I ended up with a chicken parmi) were decent.

He also gave me a pack of smokes that he had lying around in his bag (unopened) so that was wild.

Poor bloke however was falling asleep in his seat by 9pm due to his chronic lack of sleep.

Still need to catch up with his wife and potentially give her some goods in the coming weeks
