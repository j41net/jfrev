These were the only other pack of darts I was able to procure along with the Esses prior to the bucks.
Like the Esses there will always be a fond memory associated with these, given how well received they were.
They are also the first with (recorded perhaps) time I can note where there were two pop capsules within the one dart.
I love the overall flavour and the sensation it leaves in the mouth which makes it bearable even if I am not completely smashed off my face. I’d classify this one as pretty dangerous in terms of actually smoking for the sake of smoking. All in all, from all the different darts I’ve tried to procure this one seems to be the most common one when asked for the international offerings that they have.

Would Smoke Again Rating (WSAR): Yes
Pop Capsule: Y x2
