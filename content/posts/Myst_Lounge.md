Checked out this shisha lounge over at Blacktown with RK, given we normally hit up a spot at Auburn.

Our shisha had at least three flavours, unicorn (which is a bucnh of fruits such as rock melon + other melon types), el muroz and something else. Can't remember the last one because we actually went a week or two ago and I am only now getting around to writing about this lol.

The ambienace of this place is much much nicer, but I guess its not that hard to beat an alley way. That being sad for warm (but not blazing) summer days the vibe at Auburn might suit.

Myst lounge also had a Nintendo Switch (Mario Kart was loaded) and a PS5 Setup (non stop FIFA being played). Given that we met up at 8pm the place got busy pretty quick.

As usual there were a bunch of different food options there, I settled for the free popcorn (2x) and some Cammomile Tea ($4, one Twinnings Tea satchet) in a big serving. The ratio of the water and tea leaves definitely made the tea watered down but hey it was $4. They also had some dessert lady that was some sort of subcontract (?) to the business. Cleverly, none of the food items on her specific menu were marked with a price.

The catch up with RK was always mint as always. Talked about a bunch of different things and was overall a chill vibe. I can definitely see Myst becoming our regular shisha spot moving forward, even if I have to travel the distance.
