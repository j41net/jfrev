Hit up Pho An after many many years with YH (our first catch up for the year). It was her suggestion to go there.

It was BAU for Pho An. ALthough I do feel like they have renovated the interior compared to last time I was there. Probably many many years ago.

I don't actually remember my exact order. However it was a great time catching up with her.

The Koi Dessert Bar also had a popup inside Bankstown Sports Centre which we visited. Both of us forgot about using the ticket to receive a discount on our orders lol.
