Once again the new fantasy basketball season is upon us. This was the first year that we did an auction draft. Despite the initial fears and people being flakey we only had ONE auto draft for a change.

Since then we have found a different mate to take over the team who will be more active within the league. Our league format is stil the same, 10 team H2H 9cat standard.

I really wanted to opt to change the way our waiver wire system worked, just so everyone had a chance at grabbing the same players but copped a lot of opposition for that one.

Overall I can't say I am too displeased with my initial team but obviously not thrilled either. I lost my first match up 6-2-1 thanks to some wonderful FT volume afford to my opponents. They are rightfully getting smashed this week as I suspected (no massive bounces, their players popping off for no reason).

I am already trying to sort out some trades, Jalen Duren has been a nice surprise package for me if I am being honest, not sure if he is going to keep hitting those free throws at that volume (90% on 12 fts in the most recent days, pulling that off twice).

I can't believe he has pulled this off while in the middle of my match up while I am trying to trade him, which has given me something to think about.
