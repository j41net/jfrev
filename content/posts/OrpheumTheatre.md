First time at the Orpheum Theatre and man was it a nice retro vibe. From the fit out, to the uniforms I really hope this place can stay open in the long run.

I had seen the movie previously so I knew what to expect. MH also enjoyed it which was a massive plus as always

We had food at a local Thai place not too far from there. THe food there was nice and spicy and at a decent price point.
