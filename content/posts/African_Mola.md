These were initially a gift from a friend at a wedding, which he mentioned he had lying around (unsure about the time frame they spent in opened storage). After the ceremonies he told me to keep them. Quite interesting as the cigarettes all look largely similar from the outside but each has some sort of distinctive fruit related flavour after taste once smoked.
These are not particularly overwhelming on the tastebuds but leaves  your mouth feeling a little bit fresh rather than the regular ciggy after taste. Maybe I need to try a fresher pack  for better flavour but I think the true sentimentality behind these will always be:
1)  	They were a gift
2)  	Tied to our mutual friend’s wedding event (where they were freely shared with other guests)
