Went to the Angel Hotel for a pub style feed to finally catch up with AS. Given the amount of time we have been trying to organise this (granted AS was iniitally living out of state at the time) it was well worth it.

The topics of conversation went far and wide, a good solider that really gets us fundamentally given all his shifts his philosophy of living over the years. Beginning to think as a result I should try keep in better touch with him moving forward provided he's keen too. Psychedlics are king at the end of the day.

Food wise, once we rocked up it was happy hour. AS elected not to eat so he took on 1x Negroni and 2x Chardonnay over the course of the night.

I had a vodka martini followed up 2x Focaccia style pizza slices. They were nice and priced at $12 each, not super filling the bread certainly did its work to make it feel like that.

I think overall the food was OK given we were after a pub feed (and I was the only one eating anyway). The chats had were great though, and lots of beautiful human beings milling around celebrating their end of year stuff/christmas party (pres and post). 

The venue is also open til 2am so they mentioned they get a lot of people come through for the afters as well since they are one of the few places still open that late.
