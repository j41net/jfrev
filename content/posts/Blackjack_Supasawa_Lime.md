Man getting these were a slight pain. I went back to the store near uni to pick up some new goods, this time around the cashier was no way near as friendly. The guy asked me what I was after and that was it. 

I wanted to try the Mevius Blueberry 8mg so I asked for one of those and in order to try get a look at their catalogue (yes that place again) I made up some bullshit about how I didn't 'remember' the other one and could point out in there catalog.

Initially I was trying to get the Marlboro Dry Menthol one but that was sold out, so I asked the guy for something similar or his own recommendation.  Off the top of my head he reocmmended this one or the Citrus one, I decided to go with the lime because why not!

This did NOT disappoint. I don't think I have had anything so sweet! The aftertaste help put away any ashy taste that might be there which I think helped a lot. Very very dangerous if I am being honest with how easy it is to smoke, almost felt like I was taking a dose of candy with it.

It also gave me a better understanding that maybe the higher nicotine content (this had 8mg) might lead to stronger flavouring as well as a stronger nicotine hit. I've also started keeping track of photos for all the different packs for my own recording keeping. I may decide to put them up here later depending on how I feel.
