Cane back to this place after a very long time (JBBQ). Catch up with the group was well overdue.

Unfortunately we did not have a good experience given they were short on certain meats and the premium menu was out.

It was also nice to meet MZs and J's kids.

Despite all of this, we ate plenty and I was basically in a position where I couldn't lie down from overeating.

We order so much food that we couldnt finish we were also warned about wastage! Which was a first time given the number of times we have been here before.
