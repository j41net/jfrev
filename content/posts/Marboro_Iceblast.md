A pack I grabbed for a wedding as I did not want to bring a pre-opened pack and risk not having enough for the night and to go around.
There is a nice cool sensation at the end of each puff but there is a strong after taste. More suited to a higher blood alcohol level than sober (then again I’m not one to smoke unless I am drinking anyway). No additional comments – will keep em around since there are plenty more left in the pack.
However part of me thinks it might actually take some time before I can go through all of them. It is also a design of a more dead social calendar too since there isn’t much appetite from my end to sit around at home and smoke.
