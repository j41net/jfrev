It was the first time we tried this Malaysian food spot. the food here was quite nice. The heat on across the dishes were excellent and not overbearing.

From memory the menu items were as follows:

Chicken Spring Roll x2
Char Hor Fun x2
Okra Belacan - greens
Sambal udang - prawn
Kari Kambing - lamb
Ayam Berempah - fried chicken
Nasi Goreng kampung - fried rice

We also had some white rice made at home.

Overall for about $150 the food was pretty good.  A lot of the household was also pretty sick which is why we opted for the Char Hor Fun and spicy dishes.

I can definitely see us going back to this place for food again in the future. Next time to try the teas for sure!
