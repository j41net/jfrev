I visted NQ and his wife yesterday as a thank you for some photo editing he helped me out with. Gave them a plate of baklava.

They were seven minutes away from King Kebab and I haven't been there in close to a decade this was during a time when YC was coming back from the capital and in the middle of the HSP craze a bunch of us met up with him for mid trip.

I grabbed a regular chicken kebab and wolfed it down. I wasn't sure how to feel given that I should be more mindful of eating late and the overall caloric count given I should be trying to cut/watch my weight.

As expected I did end up with heartburn, probably didn't help I went to bed past 1am anyway thanks to the wonderful weather.
