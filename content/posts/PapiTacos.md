Met up with the Dota lads (uni) for a long overdue catch up. It was just the 3 of us this time and it was nice to do a day catch up with them for a change.

The tacos are nice, and they are generally messy to eat but they were really delicious. We got in just as they opened (or right after) at like 12pm and by the time we left Darlo it was quite busy. Half the reason we left was given that we had finished eating we didn't want to hold people up who were in line to take a seat. Bad for business and all that jazz.

There was also a lime (or maybe lemon), jalapeno and pineapple drink that was really unique and nice. It offset the flavours of the taco and birria soup (?) wonderfully 10/10 would have again.

Afterwards we made our way to our patented spot at Darling Square. There was a new hack/promo we used for a new Hungry Panda account. This was good to get a few dollars off for some cheap bubble tea. Not sure how long the promo pricing will last but its nice to get it done out of the way.

The chats had were always great with these guys, who knows when we will all be able to do it again, as it does feel like these days are becoming harder and harder to come by.

I got home, and after a few little while I headed out to Quakers (toll but 1hr drive still!), for a halo sesh at TWs place. The Jollof Rice he made was delicious af but I did not find it particularly spicy despite it not feeling like that at the time.

I left about 11:30pm (the others kept playing for a good while) but unfortunately got mad runs for the next day or two. I have also reduced the psyllium husk intake to two teaspoons moving forward just in case.
