TC bought two packs of Mevius ciggies from a random convenience store on his way back from JPN.

There isn't much to say about this particular pack. They are very very light.

They also are standard/regular cigarette.

There isn't much to say. I do feel like these would probably go a long way for someone attempting to taper off darts and quit them for good.

I imagine these may stay in the holding area for a good length of time.
