I actually went into a shop near uni (was there for dinner and catching up with a friend visiting from the US + other petrolheads) and whipped out my old ESSE pack asking if they had anything like them as a sign to show what I was after. I actually left once I was done eating while the others remained inside the resstaurant as the sign for the tobaccionist was staring at me right in the face and curiosity got the better of me lmao.

Unfortunately they did not have the exact ESSEs that I was showing them but basically gave me a homemade catalogue of all their offerings and GOD DAMN IT WAS HEAVEN. So much shit to try, such little time. I definitely plan on going back there when I can get the chance or even just to try something new out because it is so accessible. I was in awe of all the different offerings that I also picked up a pack of Marlboro Watermelons (review to come shortly on that one).

In the end I bought the Mevius Blueberry, think these have like 5mg content (as the chick in the store specified they didn't have any of the 8mg ones) and are quite pleasant to smoke. There is a small touch of a blueberry flavour that is most noticable right after you pop the capsule/bead. I wish I could rave about these but there really isn't much to say except I found them to be quite light and easy to smoke. Definitely something I would be open to procuring again if I have the chance or the need to.

I did note that these are probably the first Japanese branded + Made in Japan darts I had the pleasure of trying (knowingly anyway) and they did not disappoint one bit. 

Smashed a couple of these with my mate TW (known nicotine addict from his rowdy youth days) who only really smokes when out socially. Can't say I am close to the guy but this has kinda become our thing and I do enjoy the social aspect of smoking, or even having that access to simply fuck off in a social setting to do a quick social reset/breather when required.
