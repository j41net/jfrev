We hit the usual items at this place.

* Green Beans
* Lamb Skewers
* Spiced Potato and Lamb
* Eggplant Dish

Compared to the usual spot in Auburn I must say these did not hit as hard. I think the meat here was nicer but the vegetable options are much better at Tarim. If I have to choose I'd definitely stick to Tarim. The eggplant dish was a major let down but actually tasted it a bit better after it cooled down.
