We went to call you can eat wingboy sesh.

I forgot the flavours that we picked up, but we certainly got our moneys worth. The three of us hadn't met up in a very long time so it was good to see NL and CL again.

We will endeavour to meet up again in a short time after CL is back in the country from his overseas travels.
