Went to this place off on a whim to meet RK to celebrate him getting a job that I put him forward for.

I had a plate of half Somali Food and half Ethiopian Food.

The Somali half was mostly rice and very tender lamb (the mandi(?) side I am guessing) while the Ethipoian side was injera with a few different curry type situation.

The meal was very very carb heavy and some more protein would have gone a long way. The break up between the two different cuisines were great. The Ethipoian side was definitely more spicy and had more seasoning.

Outside of that, we hit up the usual shisha spot for a bit before I caught the train back home.

It was RKs shout which was very nice of him to celebrate.
