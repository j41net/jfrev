YH and myself were gearing up to see Jimmy O Yang at the ICC/Tiktok Entertainment Centre.

Prior to that we decided to grab a feed. Friday was 40 degrees temperature wise and it was busy as fuck. This only added to the heat after we both got to the city too.

The city itself was so busy we had to look around for a good while before we found our way back to Lilong. We took a ticket and actually walked around trying to find other spots near the ICC to save us a walk.

Once we got to seat it was actually quite nice with the breeze kicking it. Darling Square in general was quite lively and I am fairly certain we also saw some people leaving Jimmys first show too!

Foodwise as soon as I save the menu I knew I had to try the Drunken Chicken due to it appearing on the Warrior TV series. I quite liked it, don't think YH was a fan though. It tasted like chicken doused in plum wine. We also opted for some other colder dishes too.

To be honest, I can't remember exactly what else we ate. There was a dumpling with the usual soup/juice inside too. I might try ask and update this later.

As for the show it was great. The openers were quite funny too. One was an Australian Asian bloke with a Bengali wife and the next one was a Malaysian bloke by the name of Matthew Leong. Might try check out his show later next year when he is touring. With Jimmy, some of the sections were in Cantonese so I didn't fully understand it (although YH filled me in the jokes as best as she could).

Overall I'm glad we managed to find some tickets on such short notice and decided to attend.
