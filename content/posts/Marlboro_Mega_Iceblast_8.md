After catching up with my old work colleague AV I made the conscious decision to take a walkdown to China town with a goal in mind to grab a quick snack (whic I had already decided on to be those Hong Kong Egg Waffles as they caught my eye the day before). While I was headed there I knew in the back of my mind I was going to try find a pack of the Marlboro DRYs I had been recommendedon Redbook. While I was unsuccessful to grab a pack I caved at the shop at bought the Marlboro Mega Iceblast out of pure curiosity. I knew I was going to grab these at some point just out of pure interest. I must say while the other Marlboros seem quite strong/rough I was very surprised by this one.

Fuck, even the packaging for this one felt quite premium compared to the other Marlboroughs I have quick makes me wonder if how many of these are fake/knock offs or poorly maintained darts which is why I get varying experiences.

I will admit there is a little thrill for myself as I go on the hunt for these different darts. I have so many packs and I am unsure when or how I'll even smoke through all of them to be honest. There might be a chance I throw some of the packs out as I have no desire to smoke them (using the WSAR anyway). The price point of $20-25 really does make the novelty feeling of picking up these packs quite easy, but it is quite obvious I am high key wasting money (in general with smoking anyway).

As an aside I must say these are probably the closest I have come to tracking down my gold goose from 2018. The smooth consistency is quite easy to smoke and the menthol capsule when burst definitely leaves a long lasting cooling sensation in the mouth for a little while after the cigarettes have been smoked which is very nice. It is a bit like the after-sensation once you get done with listerine. 

I think moving forward I will definitely pay better attention for the packs to see whether or not they are fake, and the learning curve that comes with it. This particular pack looks like it came from Japan going off the writing on the side.

Would Smoke Again Rating (WSAR): Hell Yes
Pop Capsule: Y
