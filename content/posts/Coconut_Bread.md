My mum brought home some coconut bread from a colleague of hers. The process to make this bread sounded quite tedious, which contributed to its fresh taste. Basically the bread looked like bread, however there were large amounts of coconut grated finely during the making process.

I have never had anything like this before which is why I wanted to write a review on it. We heated it up on the pan before eating it and it gave itself life by forming a buttery/greasey texture. This really does seem to be the way to eat (kind of like toasting it I guess?). To me, this bread (toasted style) would go really well with a morning chai/coffee. 

The taste is quite fresh but that could also be attributed to how fresh we got it. There are only four slices so better make these count!

I will once again ask directions for how it was made and potentially post it up here.
