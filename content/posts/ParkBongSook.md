Given we were unable to do our regular hike for the public holiday due to preggers situation the gang met up at Lidcombe for lunch.

This was great, I had never been to Parkbongsook at Lidcombe and I think the menu really is different across all of its locations.

What I found convenient was the big platter of food that we got, it satisfied the four of us pretty well. The seafood pancake also held up as YW did not have a allergic reaction.

Afterwards we werent to a bingsu place near by and had an Orea Bingsu before calling it a day.

I am unsure how many more of these hang outs we will have given how burnt out everyone is and how life circumstances are changing for everyone.
