Binged this over a few days. For years I had seen this as a recommended show on Netflix back in the day (not sure if its still being recc'd now), but never clicked onto it once. There were about 39 episodes all up I think spread across three seasons. Second half of season 3 seemed a bit more focused on plot and story telling ,especially as the usual cheerleaders and their associated shenangians from the cheer squad seemed to disappear.

I think what finally pushed me over the edge was watching a random youtube clip of it, and given Alan Ritchson of Jack Reacher is also a major character here I thought why not give it a spin. Given all the bad news happening in my personal life I wanted something nice and chill that I could have on and not really pay attention to, and this show seemed to fit the bill perfectly.

The episodes clock in at 20-22mins each and honestly it captures the American Pie sex comedy/vibes pretty well except mostly in college life.

It is lots of drinking, sex, girls, sports and shenanigans which is what college/uni probably isn't like for most of us (what a damn shame at that too lmao).

Thad Castle, what a fucking character. Alan Ritchson also take a fucking bow. I don't know how he could go from playing basically a sporty version of Stifler to a super serious Jack Reacher. Bloke is clearly on gear now though (BMS body 'seems' a bit more natty).

They have a movie and I am still yet to watch it, think I got about 20-30 mins in. I also read that there is a series reboot coming so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
