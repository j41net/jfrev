We went there over as a final catch up prior to TC having a kid. This was the best rated pizza place that he had in all of Sydney, outside of Westwood (also in Newtown).

The event was actually very civil. Started at 5pm and by like 9pm or so it felt like we were home.

The pizza itself was quite nice, gourmet style. Not to mention the store was very busy (given it was a Saturday anyway). Unfortunately I do not remember all the pizzas that we had. I do remember there being a spice pepperoni pizza, a sausage pizza and some sea food variant.

For sweets we hit up Yo-chi (standard).

I do think that the night ended pretty quick, but overall it was a good time.

They also wished me a surprise Happy Birthday so that was really nice of them, which completely caught me out by shock.
