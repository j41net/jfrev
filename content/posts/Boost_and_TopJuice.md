Believe it or not despite all these years of living here I have only been to Top Juice and to Boost for the first time as of this current week.

I had one of each drink off the recommendation from a friend who was shocked that I had never been to either establishment.

At Top Juice my choice of drink was 'Berried Treasure (add Mango)'. Overall the drink was actuall quite nice, the pun in its name tells you that there are plenty of berries (not sure the exact list but I'll add to this later).

Overall the drink was a tad bit more sour than I anticipated, but honestly this could just be down to the state of the fruits I got lucked with.

At BOOST the drink I ended up with was 'Strawberry Squeeze' this almost tasted ice-creamy/yoghurty. It was pleasant, if the strawberries were sweeter that would have been absolutely insane from a sweet POV.

There is still another drink I need to try from BOOST called Mango Magic, I'll get to that later in the coming days hopefully and update this when I get the chance.
