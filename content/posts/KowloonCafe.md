I really gud that that they had a van incorporated the inside of the restaurant.

Unforuntately I got some staple rice stuff that I do not remember. I should have taken DCs advice and tried something a bit more interesting, like the lasanga which they make in Hong Kong.

It developed as a result of the British Colonizers and is a cross-cuisine menu item. Althoguh it wasn't great (from what had DC said), would have been smarter/nicer to put myself out there for something more unique.

We did spend a lot of time catching up though, given I had to go to ARs place later in the day for a catch up I basically spent most of the day outside at Bwood first followed by L'kmba.

Honestly I am bull rushing all these reviews as a way to keep track of what I have been up to during this two week break so the posts will be backdated to reflect as much.
