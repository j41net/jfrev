Another delightful pack I picked up during when I grabbed the Mevius Blueberries. I won't bother repeat the origina story here since it can be found on the other post here.

I had a look to see that these are originally from Argentina, much like the other Marlboros I find them quite harsh to begin with. Although the crush ball does release a wonderful smell the overall flavour while smoking them seems to fade pretty quick. 

Again, this could just be a reflect that the product is old/fake/received harsh treatment from customs. Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to grab another pack of these again but I am definitely a lot more conscious about these ciggies in general coming up to be fakes/knock offs.

THrough my perusing of forums/threads it seems like the go is to buy a single pack to test if the goods hold up (to confirm that the batch is good), only to then purchase a carton for the long run. I must say most of the online sellers I have encounter mostly seem interested in dealing with large batch quantities, which basically make no sense for a casual smoker like me.

The other point I have realized is I am most likely better off trying to find products originating from Japan or Korea (regardless of brand and make) to try and increase the likelihood that I am not ending up with knock offs.
