Hit up the Ramandan Night Markets for 2026. It was pretty stock standard stuff although I must say it was probably organised much better in terms of stall location.

The place was buzzing even quiet late, but I guess that is a given since it was Saturday night.

Things that we shared and consumed included pani puri (pretty bad), turkish coffee (very strong, almost bitter), knafeh (which was quite nice, not drenched in syrup and had a decent cheese ratio), there was this fish thing AR picked up which was quiet nice (he did so out of pity given how they weren't busy), camel dumplings (very easy to eat), lamb skewers (from a placed called 'skewies' of all things), lemonade (at $10 a pop it was still worth it), some indian style chicken skewers.

I was also at ABs house during the early hours of the day for pres for Mardi Gras which was nice and all. It was good to catch up and we will try make plans to catch up later with the regular boys.
