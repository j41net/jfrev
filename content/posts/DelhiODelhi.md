It is not often I go out for Indian food but given KNFG were avoiding heading out to the west for this gathering the final selection was Delhi O Delhi - some well rated Indian restaurant in Newtown.

I must say the food was quite nice. While the portioning wasn't great it didn't feel like one of those microwave'd meal spots that you find so much through the Sydney.

TC in particular was impressed, despite not having Indian food often however his wife has a flavour for it.

Outside of that the catch up was our last one for the year. I anticipate this particular group will have difficulty catching up moving forward as the group is expecting its first baby. 

This also doubles up with as a hiking group so there are definitely elements of a final hurrah that took place (at least in my eyes anyway)
