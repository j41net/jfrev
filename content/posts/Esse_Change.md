These were one of original packs I was able to procure prior to a bucks. These along with the Manchesters. Given we were all piss drunk once we started craving that sweet hit of Nicotine these were received quite well and made me feel basically like a hero as we were otherwise durrie starved for that first night.
From the initial get go these darts are much smaller than your usual/regular types. What they lack in sizing they make up for in a nice cool/chill sensation as they are smoked. The only downside is these cigarettes burn through quick due to their smaller size (and hence reduced nicotine content).
Had a quick look around and on the internet and turns out that this cigarette is smaller and lighter as it is primarily marketed/directed towards women.
