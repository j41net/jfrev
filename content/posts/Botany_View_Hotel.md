BPA gang got together for this one to meet and greet TKs new baby girl (although it has been six months).

It was great catching up with the family friend group again after so long. It is quite rare for a lot of us to be able to get together so often.

Two of them were heading off to Lady Gaga later, and that point we travelled to Sydney Park to catch up with AD and two of her Saddle Club mates also showed up. Nice to meet one and see the other one again after so long.

The food and drinks at the hotel seemed quite stock standard. I had a couple of beers (unsure the brand) and ended up with pear and yuzu lemonade-esque drink which went down easily.

I also slammed a nicotine pouch which I will put through in a separate review.
