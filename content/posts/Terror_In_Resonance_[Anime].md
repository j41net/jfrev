I found this anime after a little scene of it was used in a slowed version of 'Empty Phases' by Mr Kitty.

About half way through the series I realized/looked up that the anime was actually Shinichirō Watanabe, someone whose works I really enjoy. 

I ended up binging the entire series over the course of the day today and man that ending hit hard. It was also the first time in a long time where I really felt the opening song was a banger (especially the start).

Honestly I was surprised none of my anime head friends had seen it, I really hope they all get around to watching it in the end.

I will not elaborate much on the plot here out of fear for spoilers but man oh man that ending fucking hit hard. I scrapped the gym specifcally to finish this show and so I could enjoy my alone time at home.
