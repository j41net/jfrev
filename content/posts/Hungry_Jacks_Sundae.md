Yesterday was the first time I had tried a sundae from Hungry Jacks.

First off, I didn't even know that this was something that could be purchased as the McDonalds monopoly runs very strongly in my mind. We went through the drive-through, which also showed a bunch of other drinks and dessert options (all loaded with sugar no doubt).

The cost of the small sundae was $4. The taste was actually quite nice, it was a bit more milky than what you might get elsewhere. Next up on this list will definitely be the soft serve that they have.

I must say the burgers from HJ usually seem nicer/closer to real food the last time I made a purchase from them (at this point many years ago, don't exactly remember when). However I will make a more concerted effort in order to try these options purely out of my own interested.

The time for waiting around for these things is now over lol. I can't even recall why I have never bothered to try some of these things (maybe lack of interest/not bothered?).
