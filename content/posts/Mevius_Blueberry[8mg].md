Yeah aint no WAY I can go back to the 5mg version after this. I can see why the 8mg version was sold out the first time I tried to grab it from the store. I honestly got this one at first because it was the only one I could name drop at the store without looking at the catalogue. Redbook did give some suggestions that it would be nicer to smoke than the 5mg one and boy did the review live up to the hype.

Everything about this is basically just better than the 5mg one. It felt smoother, the flavouring felt stronger and all up a win win.

This along with the Supasawa Limes are probably duking it out right now for my number one spot.

Like seriously, I can see myself developing a habitual smoking problem if I keep running with both of these 8mg Blueberries and the Lime Supasawas.

Would Smoke Again Rating (WSAR): Hell Yeah
