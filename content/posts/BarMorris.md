We hit up three different venues, with BD and her husband.

First up was Bar Morris. Hotel lobby bar which was a bit busy. I forgot the drinks that we had but we had a massive discount due to eat club.

After our drinks were had we moved over close by to hit up some dumplings at Lees Dumplings.

You know you are not getting bang for your buck there but it was convenient. Taste is good and the location is quite busy a lot of the time.

Afterwards we hit up PJ Obriens and I was able to introduce the couple to Irish Spice Bags which they loved. BD raved about it for a good while.

The chats (as always were great) and there was plenty of booze being spread around. Caught up on the last couple of years and their relationship from how it developed to their wedding.
