      <description>&lt;p&gt;A pack I grabbed for a wedding as I did not want to bring a pre-opened pack and risk not having enough for the night and to go around.
There is a nice cool sensation at the end of each puff but there is a strong after taste. More suited to a higher blood alcohol level than sober (then again I’m not one to smoke unless I am drinking anyway). No additional comments – will keep em around since there are plenty more left in the pack.
However part of me thinks it might actually take some time before I can go through all of them. It is also a design of a more dead social calendar too since there isn’t much appetite from my end to sit around at home and smoke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These were the only other pack of darts I was able to procure along with the Esses prior to the bucks.
Like the Esses there will always be a fond memory associated with these, given how well received they were.
They are also the first with (recorded perhaps) time I can note where there were two pop capsules within the one dart.
I love the overall flavour and the sensation it leaves in the mouth which makes it bearable even if I am not completely smashed off my face. I’d classify this one as pretty dangerous in terms of actually smoking for the sake of smoking. All in all, from all the different darts I’ve tried to procure this one seems to be the most common one when asked for the international offerings that they have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These were initially a gift from a friend at a wedding, which he mentioned he had lying around (unsure about the time frame they spent in opened storage). After the ceremonies he told me to keep them. Quite interesting as the cigarettes all look largely similar from the outside but each has some sort of distinctive fruit related flavour after taste once smoked.
These are not particularly overwhelming on the tastebuds but leaves  your mouth feeling a little bit fresh rather than the regular ciggy after taste. Maybe I need to try a fresher pack  for better flavour but I think the true sentimentality behind these will always be:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These were one of original packs I was able to procure prior to a bucks. These along with the Manchesters. Given we were all piss drunk once we started craving that sweet hit of Nicotine these were received quite well and made me feel basically like a hero as we were otherwise durrie starved for that first night.
From the initial get go these darts are much smaller than your usual/regular types. What they lack in sizing they make up for in a nice cool/chill sensation as they are smoked. The only downside is these cigarettes burn through quick due to their smaller size (and hence reduced nicotine content).
Had a quick look around and on the internet and turns out that this cigarette is smaller and lighter as it is primarily marketed/directed towards women.
Would Smoke Again Rating (WSAR): Y
